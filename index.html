				Field of internship

			<p class="text">
				Position related to marketing <br>
				Examples in marketing class in university:<br>
				Required to analyze a gap in the market and design a suitable product. I was the leader of the project and was mainly in charge of recording results from brain storming and use my communication skill to get to everyone and bring the whole group to an agreement of what we are really designing. Our final product is a protein bar from the well-known brand NIKE and its main target segment are the office workers who want to keep fit and be strong but are kept in their office due to the nature of their work. In the project, I was completely in charge of discovering the gap in the market, in other words, compare the differences of reputation, tastes, flavor variety, pricing, and packaging of several well-known protein bar brands like Nestle, Go Sports, and Gatorade to find what’s missing in the market and position our product within these gaps and create a “dream product”.

				A predicament I once encountered
			</p>
			<p class="text">
				Before High School graduation, I needed to complete an Extended Essay. Due to COVID-19, my supervising teacher couldn’t make it back at school. The draft of my essay couldn’t be properly viewed by the teacher. Later, the school assigned another psychology teacher to help to guide me through the essay. As the only psychology teacher physically at school, she has a lot of work to do. After finishing my essay and sending it back to me for correction, it was 3 days before the deadline. Even worse, according to the feedback, I have to actually rewrite the entire essay. This means that I have to start from the drawing board to finish an essay between 3000 to 4000 words. With enormous amount of pressure, I did the following: 1. After solid communication with the teacher during the feedback day, I completely understood what the teacher is asking for, which served as a keystone for my essay; 2. I planned to hours of what I need to be done by the time; 3. I concentrated 100% to avoid disruptions and increase my efficiency; 4. I referred to all of my knowledge in my psychology course to correctly finish the essay. Fortunately, I was able to finish half a day before the deadline. However, due to the huge improvement of my essay since last time. My teacher is in doubt of whether this essay is my own intellectual property. Hence, in the Viva voce part, she tried asking as many questions as she could, and even made be recite partial detail of my referred article. Finally, I was able to answer all the questions and received a good grade for my essay.  <br>
				All in all, I think I have the following abilities: 1. I can work very well under pressure, I am capable of adjusting my mood to increase my efficiency at any time; 2. Solid problem-solving skill, with all the pressure, I can clear my mind and know what needs to be done and how; 3. High concentration with precision, I can finish my work with very limited time and ensure that it is of good quality since I was able to think straight and put pieces together.
